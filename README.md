# TopDesk for C64/C128 GEOS

TopDesk is a file manager for the GEOS64 and GEOS128 (for the Commodore 64 and 128 computers). It shipped as the default file manager for GEOS 2.5, and can be used to replace the "deskTop" file manager on GEOS 2.0.

The [disks with the original source](https://www.pagetable.com/?p=1339) in GeoWrite format were copied into plaintext. Inline graphics were converted into byte arrays.

As is, the source does not currently build on modern systems, but it can be used as a basis for future development.

## Version

This is TopDesk version 1.3.
